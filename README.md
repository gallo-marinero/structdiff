# structdiff
Find too distorted structures after geometry optimization with VASP

Calculates:
 - Steinhardt Order Parameters (averaged or not)
 	- System-wide normalization (order option) is evaluated too
 - Minkowski Structure Metrics (Steinhardt with weighted option enabled and
   Voronoi neighbours)
